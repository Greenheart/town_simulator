# Town simulator

A small town simulator. These are its features:

* [x] Citizens get older
* [x] Citizens get random genders
* [x] Citizens eat
* [x] Citizens get random names
* [x] Citizens die at a certain given age (65 years old)
* [x] Citizens form families
* [x] Citizens make babies
* [ ] Citizens generate food
* [ ] Citizens start with random food
* [ ] Citizens die at random ages, most probably when babies or when very old
* [ ] Citizens get jobs that might increase their chances to die (hunters, for example)
* [ ] Citizens build improvements in the land to make their life easier

Later on, I'll need to make this data visually easier, so I might need to
integrate this project with a game engine or something.

## Instructions

```
npm install
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 and watch it run!
