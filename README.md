# Town simulator

A small town simulator. Currently, its citizens only:

* get older
* get random genders
* eat
* get random names

In a short term, I want them to:

* form families
* die at a certain given age
* make babies

In a longer term, I want them to:

* generate food
* start with random food
* die at random ages, most probably when babies or when very old
* get jobs that might increase their chances to die (hunters, for example)
* build improvements in the land to make their life easier

Later on, I'll need to make this data visually easier, so I might need to
integrate this project with a game engine or something.

## Instructions

```
npm install
npm start
